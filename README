test/boileau is from Wikisource and test/baudelaire is from Project Gutenberg.
Both of them are in the public domain.

== 1. Features ==

plint is a tool to check French poetry. Specifically, it validates metric,
rhymes and rhyme genres against an unexpressive template language. It features a
command-line interface, an IRC wrapper (for use with irctk) and a web interface.
It depends on haspirater <https://gitorious.org/haspirater> and frhyme
<https://gitorious.org/frhyme>, and the web interface requires CherryPy.

The full documentation of plint's features is available in views/about.html.

== 2. Setup ==

First, make sure that you have a working python3 installation and that you have
unzip (Debian packages: python3, unzip).

Place haspirater.py and haspirater.json from haspirater in the main directory.
Place frhyme.py and frhyme.json from frhyme in the main directory (see frhyme's
README for instructions on how to generate frhyme.json). Generate the
occurrences file as follows:

  ./lexique_occurrences_retrieve.sh > occurrences

For locale support, install gettext (Debian package: gettext) and run:

  make

== 3. Usage ==

To use the program's command-line interface, run:

  ./plint.py TEMPLATE

where TEMPLATE is the template file, and provide the poem on stdin. Errors are
reported on stderr.

To run the web interface on port 5000, run plint_web.py. CherryPy is required
(but the code is easy to adapt), see
http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/tutorial.html#deployment
Beware, if you use CherryPy under Debian, simply installing python-cherrypy3
might not work (no module named cherrypy) and you may need to install CherryPy
manually (sudo python3 setup.py install).

An undocumented IRC interface for use with irctk is available (plint_irc.py).
The poem that it produces can be compiled to HTML automatically using something
along the lines of:

  while true
  do
    inotifywait poem_file
    # www/ should contain style.css
    poem2html/make_poem.sh poem_file > www/poem.html
  done

To run plint on test files, you can use test.sh. However, because of known bugs,
some errors will be reported on the test files.

== 4. Training ==

The diaeresis pattern is trained by calling

  ./train_diaeresis.sh

This is currently undocumented.
