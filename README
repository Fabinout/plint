== 1. Features ==

plint is a tool to check French poetry. Specifically, it validates metric,
rhymes and rhyme genres against an unexpressive template language. It features a
command-line interface, an IRC wrapper (for use with irctk) and a web interface.
It depends on haspirater and frhyme, and the web interface requires CherryPy.

== 2. Setup ==

Place the haspirater.json and haspirater.py from haspirater in the main
directory. Place the generated frhyme.json and frhyme.py in the main directory.
Generate the occurrences file as the standard output of
lexique_occurrences_retrieve.sh.

== 3. Usage ==

To use the program's command-line interface, run:

  ./plint.py TEMPLATE

where TEMPLATE is the template file, and provide the poem on stdin. Errors are
reported on stderr.

To run the web interface on port 5000, run plint_web.py. CherryPy is required
(but the code is easy to adapt), see
http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/tutorial.html#deployment

An undocumented IRC interface for use with irctk is available (plint_irc.py).
