== Ongoing ==

- expand the corpus of classical poetry: more Racine, more other authors
  (Boileau, Corneille, Prudhomme, etc.)
- fix problems in the new works
- Train diaresesis.json on new works
- add option to disable hiatus check on "et"
- add option to configure the diaeresis tolerance threshold
- check for duplicates in additions.txt

== Ideas ==

- Use the latest lexique (with our corrections) to generate a file of known
  words with their length, and when we have exactly one of these words ensure
  that we do not allow less syllables than indicated (but it can be more,
  because of diérèse)
- Ensure that, on words known in Lexique, frhyme returns exactly the known
  pronunciation(s); so we can use it confidently, e.g. to predict elision of the
  ending for rhyme genre and number of syllables
- remove kludge for invalid characters, split them in specific chunks
- Improve performance with profiling
- Only indicate hemistiche status when there is a problem with hemistiches
- Clean up the code to the extent possible

== Low priority ==

=== Error reporting ===

- Produce error reports first in a structured format (JSON) and translate that
  into text or into HTML
- When reporting hemistiche errors, highlight possible hemistiche positions
  where an hemistiche could have been placed

=== Diérèses/synérèses ==

- When training, take into consideration the contexts where we haven't been able
  to infer the number of syllables, and only learn at each step from the
  contexts where we are the most certain (including the unknown occurrences),
  instead of having a hardcoded default threshold
- Formally evaluate the performance of the approach without additions

=== Other approaches ===

- Learn rhyme and gender agnostically by clustering: prepare an undirected graph
  of rhyming verses, factor out suffixes, do SCC, prepare a trie

=== Misc ===

- Fuzz testing: try giving random input to plint and check that it behaves
- Better exception logging for the Web frontend

=== Problems ===

- Loanwords from English ("crumble", "single", etc.) shouldn't be elidable
- Loadwords from Italian ("ad patres") shouldn't be elidable
