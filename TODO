== Ideas ==

- Compare to the latest lexique: in how many cases is our number of syllables
  less than the one indicated in lexique? ("paon" en 1 mais "chaos" en 2)
- Adjust the diaeresis uncertainty threshold to assert that all verses are
  correct (change your opinion about the syllable with least confidence)
- remove kludge for invalid characters, split them in specific chunks
- Improve performance with profiling
- Only indicate hemistiche status when there is a problem with hemistiches

== Low priority ==

=== Error reporting ===

- Produce error reports first in a structured format (JSON) and translate that
  into text or into HTML
- When reporting hemistiche errors, highlight possible hemistiche positions
  where an hemistiche could have been placed

=== Diérèses/synérèses ==

- When training, take into consideration the contexts where we haven't been able
  to infer the number of syllables, and only learn at each step from the
  contexts where we are the most certain (including the unknown occurrences),
  instead of having a hardcoded default threshold
- Formally evaluate the performance of the approach without additions

=== Other approaches ===

- Learn rhyme and gender agnostically by clustering: prepare an undirected graph
  of rhyming verses, factor out suffixes, do SCC, prepare a trie

=== Misc ===

- Fuzz testing: try giving random input to plint and check that it behaves
- Better exception logging for the Web frontend
