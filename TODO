== Ideas ==

- Compare to the latest lexique: in how many cases is our number of syllables
  less than the one indicated in lexique? ("paon" en 1 mais "chaos" en 2)
- Adjust the diaeresis uncertainty threshold to assert that all verses are
  correct (change your opinion about the syllable with least confidence)
- Document expected errors of test.sh and commit necessary files
- remove kludge for invalid characters, split them in specific chunks
- Improve performance with profiling
- Only indicate hemistiche status when there is a problem with hemistiches

== Low priority ==

=== Error reporting ===

- Produce error reports first in a structured format (JSON) and translate that
  into text or into HTML
- When reporting hemistiche errors, highlight possible hemistiche positions
  where an hemistiche could have been placed

=== Other approaches ===

- Learn rhyme and gender agnostically by clustering: prepare an undirected graph
  of rhyming verses, factor out suffixes, do SCC, prepare a trie

=== Misc ===

- Fuzz testing: try giving random input to plint and check that it behaves
- Better exception logging for the Web frontend
